Assessing demographic patterns is critical for policymakers towards sustainable development which
affects the ecosystem on earth. However the traditional approaches for measuring the required
information are time-consuming, inaccurate and expensive, and majorly relies on incomplete data.
For example, in Africa, a significant proportion of countries, specifically 34%, have not yet conducted
the agricultural survey for a period exceeding 15 years. Additionally, in half of all African nations,
comprehensive surveys capturing the livelihoods of the entire population are conducted only once in
every six years[2]. This lack of reliable or development data hinders the effective implementation of
policies, programs, and research focused on sustainable development.
Satellite imagery provides images with higher resolution that caters to potential solution to remove
data scarcity and unreliability. Every single one of these satellites provides an unparalleled opportunity
to obtain images that can assist in evaluating the progress of sustainable development objectives [3].
These objectives encompasses various areas, including eradicating hunger, enhancing healthcare and
overall wellness, as well as constructing resilient and sustainable communities. ML models that
uses satellite imagery provides more spatial and temporal information of the location, which gives
policymakers additional data points and accurate information.
In our project we tried to implement various machine learning not limited to Randomforest, Ridge
regressor etc and deep learning algorithms such as ResNet18 [ 4]on the data collected from Demo-
graphic and Health survey (DHS) from 59 countries to predict various heath indicators. We also used

the data collected by google earth engine to match other features of the particular country collected
by its satellite images and incorporated features extracted from MOSAICKS
